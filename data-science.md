# Data Science

##### Glossary

```
Artificial Intelligence is the replication of human intelligence in computers. This was being done by introducing vast
number of rules that the computer needed to respect.

Machine Learning refers to the ability of a machine to learn using large data sets instead of hard-coded rules.
ML allows computers to learn by themselves.

Learning can be done in two ways:
Supervised Learning    : Involves using labelled data sets that have inputs and expected outputs. If the output
    generated is wrong, it readjusts recalculations. The process is iterative over the data set, until no more mistakes.
    Example: Weather predicting AI

Unsupervised Learning  : Task of machine learning using data sets with no specific structure. You let the AI make
    logical classifications of the data.
    Example: Behavior predicting AI for e-commerce website

Deep Learning: A ML method, where both supervised and unsupervised learning can be used. It allows us to train an AI to
    predict outputs
