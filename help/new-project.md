# New MkDocs project

Use this repository as a template, or follow instructions below to start from scratch:

## Prerequisite

Make sure you have mkdocs installed locally, or refer to [this](local-development.md) document.
Alternatively, if you have python installed locally, just run:

```sh
$ pip install mkdocs
or
$ pip3 install mkdocs
```

## Create new project

Create a desired project folder, and `cd` into it.

```
$ mkdocs new .
```

MkDocs [official site](https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/) is another great place to start.
