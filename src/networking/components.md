## IP Address

Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a unique string of numbers separated by periods that identifies each computer using the Internet Protocol to communicate over a network. (example, 255.255.255.255). There are two versions of IP addresses used today 32-bit (IPV4) or 128-bit (IPV6).

The IP address space is managed globally by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), and by five regional Internet registries (RIRs) responsible in their designated territories for assignment to end users and local Internet registries, such as Internet service providers. IPv4 addresses have been distributed by IANA to the RIRs in blocks of approximately 16.8 million addresses each. Each ISP or private network administrator assigns an IP address to each device connected to its network. Such assignments may be on a static (fixed or permanent) or dynamic basis, depending on its software and practices.

IP address has two principal functions

1. host or network interface identification
2. location addressing

### Subnet/Subnetwork

A logical subdivision of an IP network.

## Mac Address

A unique identifier assigned to network interface controllers for communication.

## Hardware

### Modem

Connects ISP to your home, translating analog data to digital

### Router

Controls the flow of digital data between devices. tA router creates a local network for devices to communicate, just like appartment. These are the cheapest and fastest way to connect to the internet. Have their own operating system called firmware, where default has limited functionality since most want plug-n-play.

### Switch

Box that turns one ethernet connection into several, allowing multiple wired devices to connect to internet without overloading the router.
