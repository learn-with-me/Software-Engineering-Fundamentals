## History

Kafka was originally developed by Jay Kreps, LinkedIn, later released as an open source project on GitHub in late 2010. As it started to gain attention in the open source community, it was proposed and accepted as an Apache Software Foundation incubator project in July of 2011. Apache Kafka graduated from the incubator in October of 2012.

LinkedIn continues to maintain several, including [Cruise Control](https://github.com/linkedin/cruise-control), [Kafka Tools](https://github.com/linkedin/kafka-tools), [Kafka Monitor](https://github.com/linkedin/kafka-monitor), and [Burrow](https://github.com/linkedin/Burrow). In addition to its commercial offerings, Confluent has released projects including [ksqlDB](https://ksqldb.io/), a schema registry, and a REST proxy under a community license (which is not strictly open source, as it includes use restrictions).

In the fall of 2014, Jay Kreps, Neha Narkhede, and Jun Rao left LinkedIn to found Confluent, a company centered around providing development, enterprise support, and training for Apache Kafka. Confluent, through a partnership with Google, provides managed Kafka clusters on Google Cloud Platform, as well as similar services on Amazon Web Services and Azure. One of the other major initiatives of Confluent is to organize the Kafka Summit conference series.
