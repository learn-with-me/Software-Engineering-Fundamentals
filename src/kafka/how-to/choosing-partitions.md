# How to choose # of partitions

> You want many partitions, but not too many.

## Considerations

Several factors to consider:

- What is the throughput (in bytes) you expect to achieve for the `topic`?
- What is the maximum throughput you expect to achieve when consuming from a `single partition`? A partition will always be consumed completely by a single consumer (even when not using consumer groups, the consumer must read all messages in the partition). If you know that your slower consumer writes the data to a database and this database never handles more than 50 MBps from each thread writing to it, then you know you are limited to 50 MBps throughput when consuming from a partition.
- If you are sending messages to partitions based on keys, adding partitions later can be very challenging, so calculate throughput based on your expected future usage, not the current usage.
- Consider the number of partitions you will place on each broker and available diskspace and network bandwidth per broker.
- Avoid overestimating, as each partition uses memory and other resources on the broker and will increase the time for metadata updates and leadership transfers.
- Will you be mirroring data? You may need to consider the throughput of your mirroring configuration as well. Large partitions can become a bottleneck in many mirroring configurations.
- If you are using cloud services, do you have IOPS (input/output operations per second) limitations on your VMs or disks? There may be hard caps on the number of IOPS allowed depending on your cloud service and VM configuration that will cause you to hit quotas. Having too many partitions can have the side effect of increasing the amount of IOPS due to the parallelism involved.

## Example

If you have some estimate regarding the target throughput of the topic and the expected throughput of the consumers, you can divide the target throughput by the expected consumer throughput and derive the number of partitions this way. So if we want to be able to write and read 1 GBps from a topic, and we know each consumer can only process 50 MBps, then we know we need at least 20 partitions. This way, we can have 20 consumers reading from the topic and achieve 1 GBps.

## What if I have no metrics?

If you donâ€™t have this detailed information, limiting the size of the partition on the disk to less than 6 GB per day of retention often gives satisfactory results. Starting small and expanding as needed is easier than starting too large.
