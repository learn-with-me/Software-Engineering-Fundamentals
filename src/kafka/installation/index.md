# Installation

## Prerequisite

- Java
- [ZooKeeper](./01-apache-zookeeper.md)
- [Kafka](./02-apache-kafka.md)

### Java

Set up a functioning Java environment. The latest versions of Kafka support both Java 8 and Java 11.

Though ZooKeeper and Kafka will work with a runtime edition of Java, it is recommended when developing tools and applications to have the full Java Development Kit (JDK).
