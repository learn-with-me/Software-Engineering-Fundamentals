# Licensing

In today's world it is easier to get anything online from anywhere.
Example, software, media assets, content for use, etc.

We often confuse the term freely accessible with available for free. There are very strict rules around what you can use, how you can use and for what you can use. These rules exist to maintain copyright, as well as respect for the person who has put in countless hours in creating something.

The least we can do is being mindful of the creators wishes (and of course to avoid getting in trouble).

Common places where license matter:
1. Source code
2. Media assets like images, audio, video, etc
3. Content like blog post, teaching material, etc
4. Properietary stuff on which people's livelihood may depend on.
