# Text Processing

> NOTE: THIS SECTION NEEDS TO MERGE INTO COMMUNICATION WHEN PARTLY READY. DOESN'T DESERVE IT's OWN SECTION JUST YET.

> Assumption: Text can be in form of a string or a file. Text does not mean it is readable, and can be in any encoding format.

Things we do with text:

* encryption
* encoding
* compression
* chunking
* hashing
* joining

> Note: There is a lot we do we text, but this space is still raw. And I haven't yet decided the scope of the content here.
