# OAuth

## OAuth 1.0

Under OAuth, user gives each client an individual set of credentials. If they decides they don’t like one of the clients, they can revokes its credentials, and the other nine clients are unaffected. If a client goes rogue and starts posting spam under the names of its users, the service provider can step in and revoke the credentials for every instance of that client’s and everyone else’s.

There are two versions of OAuth. OAuth 1.0 \(defined in RFC 5849\) works well for allowing the developers of consumer-facing websites to integrate with your API. It starts falling apart when you want to allow the integration of desktop, mobile, or in-browser applications with your API. OAuth 2.0 is very similar to 1.0, but it defines ways to handle these scenarios.
