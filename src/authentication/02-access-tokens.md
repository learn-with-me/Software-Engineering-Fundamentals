# API Access Tokens

API keys have unique identifiers for each user and for every time they attempt to authenticate. Access tokens are suitable for applications where many users require access. Access tokens are secure and easy to work with from an end-user perspective.

`Tokens` are bits of information often in form of a random string. Tokens generally consist of a `header` that defines the type of token and security algorithm used; a `payload` that contains user information and metadata such as token duration and time of creation; and a `signature` to verify the sender's identity and the message's authenticity.
