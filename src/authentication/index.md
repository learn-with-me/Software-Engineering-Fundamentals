# Authentication

> Scope: In this section, I'll be focusing on securing connection between two machines, how they can reliably communicate.

##### Protocols

* LDAP - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
* TOTP
* PKCE
* SCRAM-SHA
* SASL-SSL
* Kerberos - a network authentication protocol
* OAuth 2 - an authorization framework that enables applications to obtain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service, such as Facebook, GitHub, and DigitalOcean.
* SAML - Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an XML-based, open-standard data format for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, in particular, between an identity provider and a service provider. SAML is a product of the OASIS Security Services Technical Committee.
* RADUIS - Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) is a networking protocol that provides centralized Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA or Triple A) management for users who connect and use a network service.
