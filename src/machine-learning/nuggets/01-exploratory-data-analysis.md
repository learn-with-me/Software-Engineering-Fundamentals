# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is an approach of analyzing datasets to `summarize` their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods.

Think of this as telling story through data or presenting data in a way that actually conveys a point, which does not come to one easy. Some people have a knack of it, while most learn it over time.

## Why EDA?

* **Explore** - get a feel of the data, null values, missing values, data size, what can be plotted, etc
* **Inform** - to inform your findings downstream and establish some baselines. For example, if the data is categorical, trees work well with them
* **Communicate** - communicate results effectively based on audience, as business may not have the same background as you do about machine learning metrics like AUC or RMSC.

## Data Types

The kind of data types that you'll come across:

* Quantitative / numerical continuous - 1, 3.5, 10^10
* Quantitative / numerical  discrete - 1, 2, 3, 4
* Qualitative / categorical unordered - cat, dog, whale
* Qualitative / categorical ordered - good, better, best
* Date or time
* Text
