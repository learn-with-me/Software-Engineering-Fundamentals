# Learning Path

Machine learning is an extremely wide field. There is a lot to be learnt, and there won't ever be enough time. As software engineer, trying to get into the field of machine learning, you'll need to be picky about what you spend your time on.

## Applied Machine Learning

This topic dives into the application of machine learning in real world, rather than staying in the theoretical lane of general machine learning. The term `Applied` means you're not trying to prove anything, or research a topic or question an approach. The sole focus is on learning how to apply the knowledge in real world.

This also means that you won't know everything, won't know all the trade-offs, and that's ok.
