# Dark Web

The Dark Web isn’t particularly vast, it’s not 90 percent of the Internet, and it’s not even particularly secret. In fact, the Dark Web is a collection of websites that are publicly visible, yet hide the IP addresses of the servers that run them. That means anyone can visit a Dark Web site, but it can be very difficult to figure out where they’re hosted—or by whom.

The Dark Web hides server IP addresses through a combination of encryption, anonymization techniques, and the use of specialized networks like Tor (The Onion Router). Here's a brief overview of how this works:

1. **Tor Network:** The Tor network is a decentralized network of volunteer-operated servers that allows users to browse the internet anonymously. When you access a website on the Tor network, your traffic is routed through multiple encrypted nodes (relays) before reaching its destination. Each relay only knows the IP address of the previous and next relay, making it difficult to trace the origin of the connection.

2. **Onion Routing:** Tor uses onion routing to encrypt and route traffic through multiple relays in a layered manner. Each relay only decrypts one layer of encryption, so no single relay can see both the source and destination of the traffic. This provides a high level of anonymity for users and servers on the Tor network.

3. **Hidden Services:** Websites on the Dark Web often use Tor's hidden services feature to conceal their server IP addresses. Hidden services have .onion domain names and are accessible only through the Tor network. When you access a hidden service, your connection is routed through Tor relays, and the server's IP address remains hidden from both users and observers.

4. **Encryption:** Dark Web servers may use encryption protocols like HTTPS (SSL/TLS) to secure communications between clients and servers. This helps protect the confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted over the network and prevents eavesdropping by third parties.

5. **Obfuscation Techniques:** Some Dark Web operators may employ obfuscation techniques to further conceal their server IP addresses. This might include using proxy servers, virtual private networks (VPNs), or other privacy-enhancing tools to obscure the origin of network traffic.

While these measures provide a significant degree of anonymity, it's important to note that they are not foolproof. Advanced adversaries, such as government agencies or skilled hackers, may still be able to deanonymize users or servers on the Dark Web through various means, including traffic analysis, compromised endpoints, or vulnerabilities in the Tor network itself.
