# Software Engineering Fundamentals

There is nothing new in this site, that will not be anywhere else. In fact, a lot of the content here is being sourced from various authors online.

I've been mindful of giving credit to the sources as I am making these notes. In case you feel there is a lack of credit in some place where it should have been, please feel free to point it out.
