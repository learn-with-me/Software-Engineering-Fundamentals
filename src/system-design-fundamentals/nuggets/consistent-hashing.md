# Consistent Hashing

Consistent hashing is a distributed hashing technique used in distributed systems to efficiently distribute data among nodes while minimizing the need for rehashing when the number of nodes changes. It was introduced to address the challenges associated with traditional hashing methods in distributed environments, where the number of nodes can vary dynamically.

In traditional hashing, data is hashed to determine which node should store or handle that data. However, when the number of nodes changes (nodes being added or removed), most of the hashed values become invalid, leading to the need for remapping and redistribution of data, which can be resource-intensive and time-consuming.

Consistent hashing solves this problem by ensuring that the majority of the hash values remain consistent even when the number of nodes changes. Here's how it works:

1. **Hash Space:** Imagine a hash space represented as a circle. The output of the hash function maps onto this circle, and each node is assigned a range or segment on this circle.

2. **Node Assignment:** Nodes are assigned segments of the hash space based on their own hash values. This assignment is done in such a way that the distribution of data is balanced among the nodes.

3. **Data Placement:** When data needs to be stored or retrieved, it is hashed, and its hash value is mapped onto the hash space. The corresponding node responsible for that segment of the hash space is then responsible for handling that data.

4. **Node Additions or Removals:** When a node is added or removed, only a small portion of the hash space is affected. The majority of the data remains mapped to the same nodes. This minimizes the need for rehashing and redistributing data.

The benefits of consistent hashing include:

- **Load Balancing:** The distribution of data across nodes tends to be more even, preventing hotspots where certain nodes are overwhelmed with data while others are underutilized.

- **Scalability:** The system can easily scale by adding or removing nodes without requiring a complete remapping of data.

- **Efficiency:** Consistent hashing reduces the amount of data that needs to be moved or remapped when the number of nodes changes, making it more efficient in dynamic distributed environments.

Consistent hashing is widely used in distributed storage systems, content delivery networks (CDNs), and other distributed applications to achieve a balance between efficient data distribution and ease of scaling.
