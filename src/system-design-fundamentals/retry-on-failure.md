# Retry on failure

In distributed systems and networked applications, retry strategies are crucial for handling transient errors and network instability effectively.

There are several strategies to handle retries when an operation fails. Here are a few common ones:

1. **Simple Retry:** In this strategy, the operation is simply retried after it fails. This is the most basic form of retry logic.

2. **Exponential Backoff:** This is a more sophisticated form of retry logic where the time between retries increases exponentially. This can be useful to prevent overloading a system that might be struggling to handle requests.

3. **Incremental Backoff:** Similar to exponential backoff, but the delay between retries increases incrementally.

4. **Randomized Exponential Backoff:** This is a variant of exponential backoff where a random factor is introduced to prevent a phenomenon known as "thundering herd problem".

5. **Circuit Breaker:** This is a design pattern used in modern software development which is used to detect failures and encapsulates the logic of preventing a failure from constantly recurring.

6. **Linear Backoff**: This is a retry strategy where the delay between retries increases linearly. For example, if the initial delay is 2 seconds, after the first retry, the delay might increase to 4 seconds, then 6 seconds, and so on. This strategy is simpler than exponential backoff but can still help to prevent overloading a system that might be struggling to handle requests.  

7. **Linear Jitter Backoff**: This is a variant of linear backoff where a random factor is introduced to the delay between retries. This can help to prevent a large number of operations from being retried at exactly the same time, which could potentially overload the system. The delay is usually calculated as a random value within a range that increases linearly.

8. **Exponential Jitter Backoff** combines exponential backoff with a random `jitter` or variation. This strategy is used to spread out the retry attempts over time, which can help to prevent a large number of operations from being retried at exactly the same time, potentially overloading the system.

Exponential backoff (with or without jitter) is often used when you're dealing with temporary issues like network instability, while linear backoff might be more appropriate for rate limiting scenarios where you want to spread out your requests more evenly over time.

## Example

Here's an example of a simple retry mechanism in Python:

```python
import time
import random

def retry(operation, attempts):
    for _ in range(attempts):
        try:
            return operation()
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Exception caught: {e}, retrying...")
            time.sleep(1)  # wait for 1 second before retrying

def operation_that_can_fail():
    # This is a placeholder for an operation that can fail
    # In this example, it randomly raises an exception
    if random.randint(0, 1) == 0:
        raise Exception("Failed!")
    else:
        return "Success!"

retry(operation_that_can_fail, 5)
```

In this example, `retry` is a function that takes an operation and a number of attempts. It tries to execute the operation, and if it fails (an exception is raised), it waits for a second and then tries again, up to a maximum number of attempts.

Remember, the best retry strategy depends on the specific use case and requirements of your application.

## Circuit Breaker

A circuit breaker is a design pattern used in software development that allows a system to handle failures gracefully and prevent a failure from constantly recurring. It's particularly useful when the system is interacting with a remote service or resource and there's a chance that calls to this service could fail, hang, or have high latency.

Here's a simple way to implement a circuit breaker in Python:

1. Define a `CircuitBreaker` class.
2. The class should have a state, which can be "CLOSED", "OPEN", or "HALF-OPEN".
3. In the "CLOSED" state, requests are allowed through. If a request fails, the failure count is incremented. If the failure count exceeds a certain threshold, the state is changed to "OPEN".
4. In the "OPEN" state, all requests fail immediately without calling the remote service. After a certain timeout, the state is changed to "HALF-OPEN".
5. In the "HALF-OPEN" state, a limited number of requests are allowed through. If those requests succeed, the state is changed back to "CLOSED". If any request fails, the state is changed back to "OPEN".

Here's a simple implementation of a circuit breaker in Python:

```python
import time

class CircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self, failure_threshold, recovery_timeout, retry_state_threshold):
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.recovery_timeout = recovery_timeout
        self.retry_state_threshold = retry_state_threshold
        self.state = "CLOSED"
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.last_failure_time = None

    def call(self, func, *args, **kwargs):
        if self.state == "OPEN":
            if time.time() - self.last_failure_time > self.recovery_timeout:
                self.state = "HALF-OPEN"
                self.failure_count = 0
            else:
                raise Exception("Circuit is OPEN; calls are failing fast")
        
        try:
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        except Exception as e:
            self.failure_count += 1
            self.last_failure_time = time.time()
            if self.failure_count > self.failure_threshold:
                self.state = "OPEN"
            raise e

        if self.state == "HALF-OPEN" and self.failure_count < self.retry_state_threshold:
            self.state = "CLOSED"

        return result
```

In this example, `CircuitBreaker` is a class that wraps a function call. It maintains a count of consecutive failures (`failure_count`), and if this count exceeds a certain threshold (`failure_threshold`), it changes its state to "OPEN" and starts failing fast. After a certain timeout (`recovery_timeout`), it allows a limited number of requests through ("HALF-OPEN" state). If those requests succeed, it changes its state back to "CLOSED". If any request fails, it changes its state back to "OPEN".
