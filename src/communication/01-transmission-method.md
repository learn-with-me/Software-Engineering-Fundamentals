# Transmission

## Types

### Simplex


### Half-Duplex


### Duplex or Full-Duplex


## Synchronous Transmission

The term `synchronous` is used to describe a continuous and consistent timed transfer of data blocks.

These types of connections are used when large amounts of data must be transferred very quickly from one location to the other. The `speed` of the synchronous connection is attained by transferring data in large blocks instead of individual characters, which are then reassembled at the remote location.

All devices on the synchronous link must be set to the same clocking.

### Examples

- Chat Rooms
- Telephonic Conversations
- Video Conferencing 

## Asynchronous Transmission

In asynchronous aransmission, data is sent in form of byte or character. This transmission is the `half-duplex` type transmission.

The term `asynchronous` is used to describe the process where transmitted data is encoded with start and stop bits, specifying the beginning and end of each character. These additional bits provide the timing or synchronization for the connection by indicating when a complete character has been sent or received; thus, timing for each character begins with the start bit and ends with the stop bit.

- Email
- Forums
- Letters
