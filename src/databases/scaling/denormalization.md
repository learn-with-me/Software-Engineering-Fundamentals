# Database Denormalization

Database denormalization is the process of combining multiple database tables into one to improve read performance. While normalization is about breaking down a database into smaller tables to avoid data redundancy and improve data integrity, denormalization is the opposite. It's about boosting read performance of a relational database by adding redundant data or by grouping data.

In some cases, denormalization can help because it can eliminate expensive SQL joins, reduce the amount of data that needs to be read from disk, and simplify SQL queries. However, it also has drawbacks such as increased storage space, potential for data inconsistency due to redundant data, and increased complexity in maintaining data consistency.

Remember, denormalization is a trade-off. It can improve read performance, but it comes at the cost of increased storage space and potential data inconsistency. It should be used judiciously and only when necessary.
