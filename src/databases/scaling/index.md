# Database Scaling strategies

## Indexing

Analyze the query patterns of your application and create the right indexes.

## Denormalization

Reduce complex joins to improve query performance

## Database Caching

Store frequently accessed data in a faster storage layer

## Materialized View

Pre-compute complex query results and store them for faster access.

## Replication

Create replicas of your primary database on different servers for scaling the reads.

## Sharding

Split your database tables into smaller pieces and spread them across servers. Used for scaling the writes as well as the reads.

## Vertical scaling

Boost your database server by adding more CPU, RAM, or storage.
