### Understanding Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where elements are added (pushed) and removed (popped) from the same end, referred to as the top of the stack. Stacks are used in various applications such as expression evaluation, backtracking algorithms, and function call management in programming languages.
