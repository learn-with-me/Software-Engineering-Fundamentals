# AWS FSx

Amazon `FSx` makes it easy and cost effective to launch, run, and scale feature-rich, high-performance file systems in the cloud. It supports a wide range of workloads with its reliability, security, scalability, and broad set of capabilities. Amazon FSx is built on the latest AWS compute, networking, and disk technologies to provide high performance and lower TCO. And as a fully managed service, it handles hardware provisioning, patching, and backups -- freeing you up to focus on your applications, your end users, and your business.

You can choose between four widely-used file systems: NetApp ONTAP, OpenZFS, Windows File Server, and Lustre.
