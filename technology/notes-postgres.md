# PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is an ACID-compliant Object Relational Database Management System, or ORDBMS. Putting it simply, it is a relational database that allows you to relate one piece of data to another. It is high performance and highly scalable, capable of handling huge amounts of data and high-load internet applications with thousands of concurrent users. Its unique combination of simplicity and power makes it a popular choice for individual users and small businesses, but enterprise businesses like Yahoo, Uber, Disqus, and TripAdvisor as well.

Due to its first-class support for JSON, Postgres is often a good alternative to “No-SQL” databases like MongoDB.

#### Features

Postgres supports a long list of database features, including several enterprise features. Aside from standard relational database features, some of the most notable features in Postgres are:

* Streaming replication
* Schemas
* User-defined objects like operators, data types, and functions
* Nested transactions
* Table inheritance
* Partitioning
* Several unusual data types, like Money, Geometry, IP addresses, JSON, and data ranges.
* Can execute stored procedures in over a dozen programming languages, including Java, Perl, Python, Ruby, and C/C++.
