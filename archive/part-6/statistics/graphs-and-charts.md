#### Scatter Plot

Scatter Plot is a two dimensional graph with one property one x-axis and the other property on y-axis.

Straight line is linear relationship. There will be a straight relationship to data however there can be minor **noise **as well. Deviations from the graph are also termed as Noise.

#### Bar Graph \(a cumulative tool\)

Bar charts can be used to alleviate the problem of noise in Scatter plots. It helps pull groups of data into a single bar and help analyze the global trends.

Each bar can be sometimes an average of couple of data-points on an axis by grouping data.

#### Histograms \(special case of bar charts\)

Just like bar charts looks at two dimensional data, a histogram only looks at one dimensional data.

A histogram is still created two-dimensional however it is based on one data set. The other dimension would be statistics on the data such as count, etc.

#### Pie Charts

Usually used to represent relative data.
