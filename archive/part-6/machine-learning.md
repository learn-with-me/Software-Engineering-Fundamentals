### **Introduction**

Data mining is the application

Machine learning is the algorithms that we use

Weka is the data mining workbench \(Waikato Environment for Knowledge and Analysis\)

**Machine learning algorithms**

* 100+ algorithms for classification
* 75 for data pre-processing
* 25 to assist with feature selection
* 20 for clustering, finding association rules, etc.

**Basic Terminology**

Every data sample is stored in an _Instance_, which are grouped together in a _DataSet_. East instance can have a number of attributes/features that have real values. Each instance can have a class label and atmost one. Algorithms are functions that work on instances and datasets. Classification algorithms for example can be trained on DataSet and can later be applied to classify instances.

**Instance** - Representation of real world sample.

**DataSet** - Collection of Instances that belong together

**Algorithm** - Any method or technique that can work with DataSet/Instances. Can be algorithms for classification, clustering, regression, filtering, etc.

* Artificial Intelligence --&gt; Artificial Neural Networks --&gt; Deep Learning --&gt; Machine Learning
* On-demand, inexpensive, parallel hardware: GPU \(graphical processing unit\) on Amazon EC2
* Big Data
* Apache MXNet - Deep learning framework
* Application: Computer Vision, Robotics, Healthcare, Security, Retail, etc
