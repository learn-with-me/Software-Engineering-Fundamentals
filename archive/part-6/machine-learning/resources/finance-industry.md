**Random Notes:**

Quantitative Analyst - responsible for model development and technical prototyping \(using tools like Matlab and R\). At this stage, issues like performance, stability, exception management, separation of data access, analytics are not important. One is mainly looking for proof of concept.  
Once the prototype is finished, IT department is responsible for translating it into reliable, maintainable. production code. This two step process is inefficient. Use Python instead.
