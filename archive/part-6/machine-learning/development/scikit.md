### Scikit

**Installation**

Install Anaconda to handle the most

Python 2.7.12

```
pip install -U scikit-learn
pip install pydot or pip install pydotplus
pip install graphviz
```

Upgrade pip `pip install --upgrade pip`

To open pdf `open -a preview iris.pdf`

**From the code:**

* data is stored in .data
* response is stored in .target
* column names are stored in .feature\_names
* Checkout .target\_names \(self explanatory\)

**Types of Classifiers:**

* Artificial Neural Network
* Support Vector Machine
* Lions
* Tigers
* Bears
* etc.

Ideal features are \[Informative, Independent and Simple\]. Techniques to know how useful features are:

* xxxxx

Decision trees are easy to read and understand
