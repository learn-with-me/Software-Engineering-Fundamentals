# Neo4j

Neo4j is built from the ground up to be a graph database. The architecture is designed for optimizing fast management, storage, and traversal of nodes and relationships. In Neo4j, relationships are first class citizens that represent pre-materialized connections between entities. An operation known in the relational database world as a join, whose performance degrades exponentially with the number of relationships, is performed by Neo4j as navigation from one node to another, whose performance is linear.
