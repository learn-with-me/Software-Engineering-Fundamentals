# Hadoop

Large amount of heterogenous data, growing exponentially where data can be structured or unstructured. This generally results in problems like accessing and processing speed. Hadoop is an open source framework by Apache written in Java. Uses distributed computing and batch processing.

##### Modules

* HDFS \(Hadoop Distributed File System\)
  Allows data storage in small memory blocks and distributes them across the cluster

* Yarn \(Yet another resource manager\)
  Processing unit of Hadoop, allocates resources needed for processing tasks.

* MapReduce
  Java framework that executes tasks in a parallel manner by distributing it as small blocks across the cluster. Computation takes place in key-value pair

* Common
  Set of common utilities and libraries. Ensures hardware failures are managed by Hadoop cluster automatically.

##### Features

* Fast
* Scalable
* Cost effective
* Resilient to failure

By default the data is replicated thrice across clusters.
