# Mistakes setting up goals

I know people who do not set. Felt better that atleast I set it every year. Worked well for me until I hit max of me due to life, age, etc. Plan had to change.

##### Issues

Setting multiple goals for the whole year \(achievable but not realistic\)

Mixing up goals with all I wanted to do, No good chunk of time in the day

Discipline, Starvation, Attempt to extreme multi-tasking, Too many distractions

##### Solution

Remind yourself

Break and track per quarter
