### IDE \(Integrated Development Environment\)

It originally sounded like a good idea to let professionals do the work; not anymore. What I mean by this statement is, I had been so used to working in a language specific IDE, that it never occurred to think about having one for all. Now with the changing needs of this changing world, depending on my personal interest, at times there are needs to jump in for a full-stack development. Having multiple IDEs open means keeping more system resources occupied. The goal here is to learn an IDE good enough to be able to use it for all the work you are going to do, identifying IDE features important to you; or atleast reducing the number of IDEs required.

Investing in learning multiple IDEs or occupying system resources in multiple installation is just not a good idea anymore, hence this section covers a little dive into most popular IDEs available today in the market and what they support.
