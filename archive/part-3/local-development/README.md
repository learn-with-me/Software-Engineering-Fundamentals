##### Package Manager

```
Collection of software tools that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing computer
programs for a computer's operating system in a consistent manner. Package managers are designed to eliminate the need
for manual installs and updates.
A package manager deals with packages, distributions of software and data in archive files. Packages contain metadata,
such as the software's name, description of its purpose, version number, vendor, checksum, and a list of dependencies
necessary for the software to run properly. Upon installation, metadata is stored in a local package database. Package
managers typically maintain a database of software dependencies and version information to prevent software mismatches
and missing prerequisites.
Example: Homebrew, MacPorts, apt, pacman, etc
