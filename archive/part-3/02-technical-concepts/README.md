Mocks - used as a replacement for a dependency
Spies - creating a spy requires an instance to spy on. Itâ€™s spying on a real object.
Stubs

The need to use a spy to partially mock a class is an indicator that a class is doing too much, thus violating
	the single responsibility principle.

Mockito
	create a mock
	tell Mockito what to do when specific methods are called on it
	use the mock instance in your test instead of the real thing
After the test
	query the mock to see what specific methods were called
	or check the side effects in the form of changed state

import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;

Out of the box, Mockito cannot mock final classes and final or static methods.
If you really need it, Mockito 2 provides the experimental MockMaker plugin.
Also note that the methods equals() and hashCode() cannot be mocked.
