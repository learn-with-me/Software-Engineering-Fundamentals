# Learnings 2017

A year has 365 days, and one or the other day you tend to run into challenges knowingly or unknowingly. With every decision you take, affects your tomorrow. This is my doc.

###### What all was going on?

Baby, Full Stack transition, Masters, Personal Projects, Finance

#### Transitioning into a full stack developer

I've professionally worked in Java for almost 7 years, and JavaScript now for almost 5 years. Being a lead developer, this year I had a goal in mind, to be the go-to Full stack person for my team.

> Challenge: Too much to keep up with

###### So what happened?

The way you function when working on one and only one language is different. You learn a small bit of implementation, and then apply to your business, grow on it and then learn more. A full-stack profile had different meanings to different people online when I looked up. I started with knowing it all and everything. In practical sense, that does not work out at all.

#### Notebook

> Challenge: Remember everything I knew or was learning

Picking up new technology or task is not as hard, especially when the work is basic level

#### Learning

Now, if you pick up a big target \(not necessarily a bad thing\), you absolutely need to plan it right, breaking down it into small steps. Without a plan, I realized I was jumping between topics, from one source to another. At a time I had around 80 tabs open in the browser, relating to atleast 10 topics at a time. And if your computer crashes for some reason, there is mourning for an hour about loosing all the information you were in middle of, and not able to recall anything from your head or browser history \[because that's fucking stupid\]. If you happen to have superpowers, that's ok, for rest of the common people, this is insanely confusing act.

#### Starting Personal projects

Working at Priceline.com has been, in a way life-changing for me. Taught a lot about talking to the world of developers out there. Teaching self and solving daily work-life problems with writing your own software and exploration.

> Challenge: Working on the entire project end-to-end without help and time

Why was this important? Did it had to be this year?

Short answer is yes. Learning something new is the easy part. Hard part is retaining all that information, esp. when working full stack. Plus you don't work in a technology long enough to make it muscle memory. The answer to all that was personal projects. Since long, I've been wanting to start few personal projects to solve daily life problems. This was now or never for me.

##### Good Parts

##### What Tech I did this year?

Desire to grow and how to achieve it?
