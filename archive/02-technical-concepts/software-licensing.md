# Software Licensing

When you develop software, it is important \(and suggested\) that you license your code, especially when you are writing open-source software. It for your own benefit as well as someone who intends to use your software to understand the limitations you would like to enable. Licensing is a well known practice that lets everyone else know the "terms of using" your software.

For example, you may be wanting to let everyone use your software any how, build applications over it, modify it, or whatever. One such license is MIT. Adding license to your code just made it clear so the consumers are clear of their rights and not work on assumptions.

As lightly we would like to take this step or care-free, it acts as clear communication between two parties.
