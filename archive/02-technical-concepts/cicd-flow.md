# Continuous Integration

A general approach

#### Guiding Principles

* Decrease time to market.
* Full observability of customer transactions, change events, runtime inventories in Production and supply-chain auditing.
* Leverage cloud-native tooling and processes while moving workloads to viable and sustainable first-party GCP services.
* Significantly increase Developer Velocity.
* Define scalable processes, constraints and software implementations that can be federated more broadly across the company.
* Focus on Domain Driven Architecture to ensure isolation from upstream dependencies across availability, performance, testing, costs and resource allocation.

#### Deployment Process

Define Node patterns as a process and documentation:

* Building and maintaining web and API servers
* Containerized Node applications
* Cloud CI/CD pipeline
* Monitoring and logging, distributed tracing
* Security: image and dependency scanning
* Dynamic routing and Service discovery
* Common Node modules and middleware
* Improve local development environment
* Blue-green and canary deployment
* GraphQL architecture standards and patterns

Improve Node/React boilerplate to include most of the patterns and best practices. The boilerplate is becoming a toolkit or scaffolding, which will be one of the dependencies in all Node web applications. To get the latest updates, product teams will have to update "toolkit" dependency version. It creates a level of abstraction, similar to a framework, which allows developers to focus more on their product.
