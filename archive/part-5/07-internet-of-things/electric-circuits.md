# Electric Circuits

Basically an electric loop with a starting point and an ending point - with any number of components in between including resistors, diodes, inductors, sensors of all sizes and shapes, motors, and other handful components

##### Components

```
Jumper wire
LED
Resistor
Potentiometer (a variable resistor)
Diode
Photo Resistor (Changes resistance based on light input)
Piezo Buzzer
Temp Sensor
Transistor
DC Motor
Push button
Flex sensor
Soft Potentiometer
Servo (Like a motor but better when need is to move accurately)
Relay
Integrated Circuit
LCD
Breadboard
```
