```

##### What to pick

```
Motherboard
    Make sure it supports the amount of graphic card
    Features (more USB ports, more legit power components for overclocking, built-in WiFi, multiple network adapters)
    (more storage options as PCI m.2 slots and n.2 connectors, RGB)
    Example: MSI Z270-A PRO, Z370
Graphics Card
    If you're going to have multiple GPUs, have all of them of same company (for crypto mining)
    See if your processor allows more than 4 graphics card or the number of GC you want to have in the OS
    8GB min
    Example NVIDIA GTX 1070
Power Supply
    Try to get the highest efficiency rating. If efficiency is low, you're going to supply more power.
    Pick up any Platinum or Titanium
    1200Watt or more if you ever want to run multiple GC or devices, otherwise 750Watt
    Adds to overall cost.
    Think dual power supply for Pro
Memory
    16GB (32GB preferred)
Processor
    Clock speed
    Number of cores (atleast 4)
    Overclockability
    Example: Ryzen 5
Powered PCIE Extenders
```
