# Internet Of Things

This section has been re-written a lot of time and IOT sounded better given what I am documenting here

##### Micro-Controller

```
A micro-controller (abbreviated Î¼C or MCU) is essentially an entire computer system on a single, tiny microchip!
While not as fast or powerful as your desktop or laptop computer, a microcontroller excels at being very small, very
inexpensive, and can operate on very little power (great for battery-powered devices).

Micro-controllers are the heart of what's called "Embedded Computing" - a term used to describe using these tiny
computers inside everyday things to make them "smart" - things like microwaves, cars, cellphones, TVs, and so on.

A microcontroller has many subsystems on board it's tiny little chip.
* microprocessor core            // brain of the computer
* RAM (Random Access Memory)     // where the software can store data temporarily. Memory is lost when power goes off.
* Flash memory                   // where the software program is stored.  This memory is not lost when power goes off.
                                 // It is similar to the SD card in your smartphone or digital camera.
* EEPROM (Electroniclly Eraseable Programmable Read Only Memory)
                                 // Special type of memory that can retain data after the power is turned off.
                                 // Good place to store things like configuration settings. Only stores data, not code.
* IO (Input/Output) Systems      // this is how the microcontroller communicates with the outside world.
                                 // There's many different types of I/O, such as digital (1s and 0s), analog (variable
                                 // voltage), PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) which falls somewhere between digital and
                                 // analog, and many types of computer protocols like Serial, I2C, Parallel, CAN, 2WI,
                                 // and more.
