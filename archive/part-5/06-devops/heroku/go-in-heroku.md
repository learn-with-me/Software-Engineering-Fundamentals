# Go in Heroku

    vendor.json
    Heroku recognizes a Go app by this file's existence in the vendor directory located in applicationâ€™s root directory.
    The `vendor/vendor.json` file is used by `govendor` and specifies both the dependencies that are vendored with your
    application and the build configuration Heroku should use to compile the application.

    os.Getenv("PORT")
