# Google Cloud Platform \(GCP\)

Its not fair to say this section cover a lot about every aspect of GCP. GCP is huge. We'll have tailored information on how to get started, what and where to look at.

#### Interacting with GCP

1. UI \([https://console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com/%29%29%29%29\)  
   Useful to create VMs, setup clusters, provision resources, manage teams, etc.

2. Command line \(SDK\)  
   Useful for resources once provisioned. E.g., ssh into instances , submit jobs, copy files, etc

Note: Qwiklabs trainings provide you with a Google cloud account. Do NOT use your own to avoid charges.
