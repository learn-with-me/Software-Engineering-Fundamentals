# Cloud Computing

There is no one cloud fits all solution. Pick cloud deployment models after understanding your workload.

#### Cloud Deployment Models

* Private - More secure. You own the hardware and run the cloud on premises. 
  * Open Stack
  * VMWare
* Public - Elastic scaling. Leveraging cloud services over internet using software and hardware that you do not own.
  * Microsoft Azure
  * Google
  * AWS
  * RackSpace, IDC Frontier, HP Cloud, etc
* Hybrid - Seamless. Mix of both
* Traditional - You do all by yourself
  * Bare Metal

#### Types of Cloud

* Saas - Finished application you rent and customize over the internet. Removes the need for organizations to install and run hardware and software within their own data centers and eliminates software/hardware provisioning and licensing.
  Replaces enterprise applications. Cheaper way to consume enterprise applications such as CRM and ERP.
  * Salesforce.com
  * Google Apps
  * Microsoft 365
* IaaS - Deployment platform that abstracts the infrastructure. Third-party provider hosts hardware, software, servers, storage and other infrastructure components on behalf of the end user. Hosts infrastructure services found in a traditional data center such as compute, storage, etc. Also provide application and data hosting for existing enterprise workloads. Can host private, public and hybrid deployment models.
  Designed to replace Storage and Compute services. Cheaper platform for applications and data.
  * AWS \(Storage & Compute\)
* PaaS - Deployment platform that abstracts the infrastructure. Cloud version of application development and deployment. Reduce application development and deployment cost. Third-party provides a platform allowing users to develop, run and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure themselves.
  Cheaper ways to build web-based systems that enforce standards.
  * Google App Engine
  * AWS's Elastic Beanstalk
  * Microsoft Azure
