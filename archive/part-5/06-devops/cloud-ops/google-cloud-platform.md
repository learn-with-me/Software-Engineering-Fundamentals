# Google Cloud Platform

### Cloud Computing

A cloud computing service provides the below five important traits

* **On-demand self-service** - no human intervention needed to get resources
* **Broad network access** - access from anywhere
* **Resource pooling** - provide shared resources to customers
* **Rapid Elasticity** - get more resources quickly as needed
* **Measured service** - pay only for what you consume

> IaaS model - You pay for what you allocate  
> PaaS model - You pay for what you use.
