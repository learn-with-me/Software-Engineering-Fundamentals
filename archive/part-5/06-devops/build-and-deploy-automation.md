#### Continuous Delivery

Core foundation of DevOps.

* Automated Build & Deploy
  * SCM/Version
  * Build Scripts
  * Dependency Map
  * Component Deploy
  * System Deploy
* Automated Testing
  * Test Scripts
  * Test Deploy
  * Load/Soak Scripts
  * Data Provisioning
  * Baseline/Benchmark
  * Testing Reports
* Automated Provisioning
  * Image Management
  * Patch Management
  * Auto Env Deploy
  * Start/Stop Scripts
  * Rolling Upgrades
  * Security Configuration

#### Continuous Testing

Sits between Continuous Deployment and Continuous Delivery. Automate as much as you can, so testing occurs on click of a button.

* Confirm desired functionality
* Catch programming syntax errors
* Standardize code patterns and format
* Reduce bugs
* Make applications more secure
* Make sure to include
  * Security testing
  * Performance testing
  * Integration testing
  * Logging and automated feedback
  * Template management
  * Layered testing, including regression and unit testing

#### Continuous Integration

Ability to perform Coding, Planning, Measuring, Operating, Deployment, Release, Test, and Building over and over again. This is more about reducing latency and being able to leverage technology for instant feedback.

Key goals are:

* Find and address bugs quicker
* Improve Software quality
* Reduce the time to validate and release software updates

#### Continuous Deployment

Focused on automating the delivery of systems. Brings tighter working relationship between development, operations and the end user.
