# Terminal Tricks

Tired of trying to remember everything out there..... documenting some of the basic work that comes up once in a while

#### Commands

```
Linux Hardware information
$ hostnamectl
$ cat /etc/os-release

Yet to sort
$ systemctl
```

#### Setting up SSH keys

##### Generating a new SSH key

```
This creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label.
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

```
