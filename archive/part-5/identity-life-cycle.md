# Identity Access Management

The way companies do business is changing. Software-as-a-Service and cloud-based applications empower companies of all sizes to innovate and grow. At the same time there are some key challenges, when it comes to access management

* Identifying the most beneÔ¨Åcial apps and services for the business, and enabling employees to use the apps they need without exposing them to risk
* The sheer pace of innovation as a result of the adoption of web-based applications
* The need to securely manage, identify and access cloud-based applications in an environment that is fast-paced, always changing, and highly mobile

Cloud-based identity and access management solutions, including single sign-on, password management and analytics is the solution to all these challenges.

At core, Identity life cycle is broken into four parts:

1. Provision
   1. Create new users in systems like Google Apps or Microsoft 365 and manage user identity across all cloud applications.
2. Single Sign-on
   1. Grant users secure one-click access to the cloud apps required for their role
3. Manage Access
   1. Change the cloud applications that users can access and the rights they have, plus audit password security and usage
4. Deprovision
   1. Deactivate or delete a user to permanently remove access to any of your cloud applications
