# NPM

Most popular choice for Node as a package manager. It puts modules in place so that node can find them, and manages dependency conflicts intelligently. It is extremely configurable to support a wide variety of use cases. Most commonly, it is used to publish, discover, install, and develop node programs.

However, there is a known issue with using NPM. You cannot guarantee that the bundle you installed on one machine is going to be same on another machine. Even after using shrinkwrap. This is where Yarn comes in.
