##### Top mistakes using Node.js

```
• Writing a CPU bound code like sorting a really large array
• Invoking a callback more than once, for example res.send or resolve
• Deeply nesting callbacks is often known as callback hell
• Expecting callbacks to run synchronously. If callback returns a promise, it won't run as expected.
• Assigning to “exports”, Instead of “module.exports”
