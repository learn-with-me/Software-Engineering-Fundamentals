# Web Application

Web application is a client-server computer program that runs in a web browser.

HTML5 introduced explicit language support for making applications that are loaded as web pages, but can store data locally and continue to function while offline.

### Architecture Classification

* Static web page - good for single page or website with low resources and no interaction
* Dynamic web page
* Multi-page app \(MPA\)
* Single page app
* Progressive web app

### Mobile Web Applications

Mobile web applications are built to target mobile devices. There are several ways of targeting these devices:

##### Responsive Web Design \(RWD\)

Approach that makes web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. A site designed with RWD adapts the layout to the viewing environment by using fluid, proportion-based grids, flexible images, and CSS3 media queries, an extension of the @media rule, in the following ways

Can be used to make a web application - whether a conventional web site or a single-page application viewable on small screens and work well with touchscreens.

Responsive web design has become more important as the amount of mobile traffic now accounts for more than half of total internet traffic. Therefore, Google announced Mobilegeddon in 2015, and started to boost the ratings of sites that are mobile friendly if the search was made from a mobile device.

##### Adaptive Web Design \(AWD\)

Where responsive design relies on changing the design pattern to fit the real estate available to it, adaptive design has multiple fixed layout sizes. When the site detects the available space, it selects the layout most appropriate for the screen. So, when you open a browser on the desktop, the site chooses the best layout for that desktop screen; resizing the browser has no impact on the design.

### Progressive Web Apps \(PWA\)

Web applications that load like regular web page but can offer the user functionality such as working offline, push notifications and device hardware access traditionally available to native mobile application.
