##### Lambda Expressions

```
Basically Java's answer to functional programming.

A Lambda Expression is a representation of anonymous function which can be passed around as a parameter
thus achieving behavior parameterization. A lambda consists of a list of parameters, a body and a list of
exceptions that can be thrown, i.e., it is very much a function, just anonymous.

An instance of a lambda can be assigned to any functional interface whose single abstract method defintiion
matches the definition of lambda.
